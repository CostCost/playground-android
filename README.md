# Playground Android

This is a template project for Android development. I use it as a way
to test new concepts or integrate libraries that are otherwise hard
in a more complex project.

Some of the concepts implemented here:

- [x] multi module setup (see `:common` & `:domain`)
- [x] dependency injection with kotlin-inject
- [x] logcat lib and injecting multiple loggers
- [ ] USF architecture (much like [usf-movies-android](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/movies-usf-android))
